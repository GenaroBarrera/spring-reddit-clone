 * Class: Custom Exception
 * Once the email message is prepared, we send the email message.
 * If there are any unexpected exceptions raised during sending the email,
 * we are catching those exceptions and rethrowing them as custom exceptions.
 * This is a good practice as we donâ€™t expose the internal technical exception details to the user,
 * by creating custom exceptions, we can create our own error messages and provide them to the users.
